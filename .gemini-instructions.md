# Gemini Instructions

## General Principles

*   **Keep functions small and composable:** Each function should have a single, well-defined purpose. This makes the code easier to read, test, and reuse.
*   **Defensive Programming:** Anticipate potential issues and handle them gracefully. This includes validating inputs, checking for null values, and using error handling to prevent crashes.
*   **SOLID Design:** Where possible, adhere to the SOLID principles of object-oriented design. This will help to create a more maintainable and scalable codebase.
*   **Comments:** Keep comments professional, to the point, and with a touch of humor. Comments should explain the *why* behind the code, not the *what*.

## Git Workflow

*   **Conventional Commits:** Use the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) specification for your commit messages. This provides a standard format for commit messages, which makes it easier to automate tasks and generate changelogs.
*   **Commit Message Formatting:** Follow standard best practices for git commit messages. This includes a short, descriptive subject line, followed by a more detailed body that explains the changes in more detail.

## Communication Style

*   When you are done with a task, you don't have to print out things like "I'm finished and will now notify the user."
